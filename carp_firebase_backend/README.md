# CARP Firebase Data Backend

A Flutter plugin for uploading data from the [CARP Mobile Sensing Framework](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/carp_mobile_sensing) 
to a Google Firebase data backend.

[![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/carp_firebase_backend.svg)](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/carp_firebase_backend)

For Flutter plugins for other CARP products, see [CARP Mobile Sensing in Flutter](https://github.com/cph-cachet/carp.sensing-flutter/blob/master/README.md).

This package can upload sending data to Goggle Firebase in two ways.

### Google Firebase Storage

By using the Google Firebase **Storage** endpoint, CARP sensing data are uploaded as raw or zipped JSON file, generated using the 
[`FileDataManager`](https://pub.dartlang.org/documentation/carp_mobile_sensing/latest/datastore/FileDataManager-class.html) 
in `carp_mobile_sensing`.
In Firebase, files with sensed data is stored in the `path` specified in the `FirebaseStorageDataEndPoint` plus subfolders for each study and device. 
The path on Firebase hence follow this pattern:

`/<path>/<study_id>/<device_id>/`

### Google Firebase Database

By using the Google Firebase **Database** endpoint, CARP sensing data are uploaded as raw JSON data points, using Firebase as a  
[`DataManager`](https://pub.dartlang.org/documentation/carp_core/latest/carp_core/DataManager-class.html) in `carp_mobile_sensing`.
In Firebase, data json objects are stores in the `collection` specified in the `FirebaseDatabaseDataManager`
JSON objects will be stored in collections named 

`<study_id>/<device_id>`
 
relative to this path. For example, if `collection` is `carp_data`, `study_id` is `1234` and `device_id`is `987234`, the data will
 be stored as documents in `carp_data/1234/987234/`.



## Setting up support for Google Firebase (GF)

For Firebase to work with your Flutter app, configuration of both GF and the Flutter app has to be done. 
Please follow the step below in details, since the level of debugging/error messages are quite limited 
when setting this up. If you are new to Firebase, then please start by reading the extensive 
[Firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/) first.

### In Google Firebase
1. Create a Firebase project with a [cloud storage](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage/)
1. Add Firebase to your  [Flutter](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup) project by following the description. 
Note that you need to add support for both the Android and iOS version of the Flutter app.
2.  [Download the configuration file](https://support.google.com/firebase/answer/7015592) named `google-services.json`
and make sure to put in in your Android app module root directory, i.e a folder like `<appname>/android/app/`
3. Add support for the [Google Services Gradle plugin](https://developers.google.com/android/guides/google-services-plugin)
 to read the `google-services.json` file that was generated by Firebase.
    * in your IDE, open `android/app/build.gradle`, and add the following line as the last line in the file:
    
     ` apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'`
    
    * In `android/build.gradle`, inside the `buildscript` tag, add a new dependency:
     ```
     dependencies {
             // ...
             classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.0.1'   // new
         }
     ```
    * note the version of this SDK may chance - see [Add Firebase to Your Android Project](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup#manually_add_firebase) 
4. Configure [authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/)
    * `carp_firebase_backend` supports two types of authentication:
         * [username/password](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/android/password-auth) authentication
         * [Google Sign-In](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/android/google-signin) on Android
5. Add users that can upload data e.g. via the console
6. Set up your [storage security rules](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage/security/start) as shown below.

```
# Default access rule
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

* for testing/debugging purposes, you may remove authentication by the authentication rule below (but should be removed
in production)

```
# No authentication rule
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write;
    }
  }
}
```

Your Flutter app should now be connected to Firebase.

### In your Flutter App

In Flutter, the `carp_firebase_backend` plugin is used to upload data from `carp_mobile_sensing` to a Firebase endpoint.

Add the `carp_firebase_backend` plugin to the `pubspec.yaml` file.

```dart
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  carp_firebase_backend: ^0.2.0     # support for uploading CARP data to Firebase
```

Run `flutter packages get`. For more information on managing packages and plugins, 
see [Using Packages](https://flutter.io/using-packages/).


## Using the Plugin

Upload of files to Firebase Storage uses the `FirebaseStorageDataManager` and
upload of json objects to Firebase Database uses `FirebaseDatabaseDataManager`.
Using the library takes three steps.

### 1. Register the Data Managers

First you should register the data manager you want to use (or both) in the `DataManagerRegistry`.

````dart
    DataManagerRegistry.register(DataEndPointType.FIREBASE_STORAGE, new FirebaseStorageDataManager());
    DataManagerRegistry.register(DataEndPointType.FIREBASE_DATABASE, new FirebaseDatabaseDataManager());
````

### 2. Specify Access Details to the Firebase App
 
Both data managers uses a `FirebaseEndPoint` object to handle access to Firebase. 
In this object, Firebase endpoint configuration keys are stored as well as authentication details. 
All of the Firebase configuration keys can be found in the _Projects Settings_ in the Firebase Console.
Remember to register your app in Firebase, as described above.
The `firebaseAuthenticationMethod` key specify the authentication method. Currently, only _email/password_ and 
_Google Sign-In_ is implemented (even though `FireBaseAuthenticationMethods` lists them all (for future use)).
 

**Using email/password as authentication**

````dart
  final FirebaseEndPoint firebaseEndPoint = new FirebaseEndPoint(
      name: "Flutter Sensing Sandbox",
      uri: 'gs://flutter-sensing-sandbox.appspot.com',
      projectID: 'flutter-sensing-sandbox',
      webAPIKey: 'AIzaSyCGy6MeHkiv5XkBtMcMbtgGYOpf6ntNVE4',
      gcmSenderID: '201621881872',
      androidGoogleAppID: '1:201621881872:android:8e84e7ccfc85e121',
      iOSGoogleAppID: '1:159623150305:ios:4a213ef3dbd8997b',
      firebaseAuthenticationMethod: FireBaseAuthenticationMethods.PASSWORD,
      email: "some_email@dtu.dk",
      password: "some_password");
````

**Using Google Sign-In as authentication**


````dart
  final FirebaseEndPoint firebaseEndPoint = new FirebaseEndPoint(
      name: "Flutter Sensing Sandbox",
      uri: 'gs://flutter-sensing-sandbox.appspot.com',
      projectID: 'flutter-sensing-sandbox',
      webAPIKey: 'AIzaSyCGy6MeHkiv5XkBtMcMbtgGYOpf6ntNVE4',
      gcmSenderID: '201621881872',
      androidGoogleAppID: '1:201621881872:android:8e84e7ccfc85e121',
      iOSGoogleAppID: '1:159623150305:ios:4a213ef3dbd8997b',
      firebaseAuthenticationMethod: FireBaseAuthenticationMethods.GOOGLE);
````

### 3. Create the Data Endpoint 

Finally, you create the data endpoint (`FirebaseStorageDataEndPoint` or `FirebaseDatabaseDataEndPoint`) providing it
with a `FirebaseEndPoint` and add it as your `Study` data endpoint.

**Firebase Storage Endpoint**

````dart
  final FirebaseStorageDataEndPoint storageEndPoint =
      new FirebaseStorageDataEndPoint(DataEndPointType.FIREBASE_STORAGE, firebaseEndPoint, 'sensing/data');

  storageEndPoint.bufferSize = 1000 * 1000;
  storageEndPoint.zip = true;

  Study study_1 = new Study("1234", "user_1@dtu.dk", name: "Test study #1");
  study_1.dataEndPoint = storageEndPoint;
````

Note that a `FirebaseStorageDataEndPoint` extends the `FileDataEndPoint` class and parameters related to 
how to create the files can be specified, including `bufferSize`, `zip`, and `encrypt`.
In the example above, the file buffer size is set to 1 MB, which is zipped before upload.


**Firebase Database Endpoint**

````dart
  final FirebaseDatabaseDataEndPoint databaseEndPoint =
      new FirebaseDatabaseDataEndPoint(DataEndPointType.FIREBASE_DATABASE, firebaseEndPoint_2, 'carp_data');

  Study study_2 = new Study("5678", "user_2@dtu.dk", name: "Test study #2");
  study_2.dataEndPoint = databaseEndPoint;
````
