// This is the debug sampling schema used by bardram
// His eSense devices are
//
//        |     name    |     id
//  ------+-------------+--------------------
//  right | eSense-0917 |  00:04:79:00:0F:4D
//  left  | eSense-0332 |  00:04:79:00:0D:04
//
// As recommended;:
//   "it would be better to use the right earbud to record only sound samples
//    and the left earbud to record only IMU data."
//
// Hence, connect the RIGHT earbud to the phone using classic Bluetooth (for
// audio streaming), and use the LEFT earbud for IMU data collection using BLE
// as part of a mobile sensing study.

/// A [DeviceDescriptor] for an eSense device used in a [StudyProtocol].
///
/// **From the eSense User Documentation:**
///
/// Both the left and right earbud have a microphone onboard. The microphone can
/// be used to record audio samples as well as input source for phone or VoIP calls.
///
/// There is no need for special configuration to use the microphone on the earbud.
/// Once the earbud is paired (Bluetooth Classic interface), the host device will
/// recognize the earbud as a new input source. The audio recorded is mono, only
/// from the earbud paired with the host device. The same happens for calls, only
/// the speaker and microphone on the earbud paired with the host will be used
/// during an active call.
///
/// Either the right or left earbud (but not both) can be paired
/// with a host device. If the left earbud is paired, the same host device can
/// also connect to the BLE interface of the earbud to collect IMU data at the
/// same time as audio is recorded from its microphone. The earbuds are limited
/// devices and the achievable data rate of the sensors (microphone and IMU)
/// might be affected by the number of operations performed. For example, if
/// the IMU and the microphone are enabled on the same earbud while the user is
/// also listening to music, it might not be possible to achieve the desired data
/// rate and the music might be interrupted. In this situation it would be better
/// to use the right earbud to record only sound samples and the left earbud to
/// record only IMU data.
