## 0.40.1

* fix of issue [#269](https://github.com/cph-cachet/carp.sensing-flutter/issues/269).

## 0.40.0 - BREAKING

* One purpose of this release is to make CAMS more stable across app re-restart (since the OSs (Android / iOS) increasingly are killing apps). This has lead to the following changes:
  * `MarkedMeasure` is no longer a separate measure type. The state of all measure are now saved across app restart.
  * A `OneTimeTrigger` no longer needs an id (this is now handled behind-the-scene).
  * All `AppTask` are now scheduled persistently using the notification system. When an app task is due, a notification is made on the phone, and when the user taps this notification, the app is (re)started.
  * As part of this, CAMS now asks for permissions to use notifications on the phone (if the `SmartphoneDeploymentController`is configured to use notifications).
* Another purpose is to change the configuration of the measures in the study protocol to resemble the newly released version 1.0.0 of the [CARP Core Framework](https://github.com/imotions/carp.core-kotlin) (Note, however, that CAMS is not yet updated to version 1.0.0 of CARP Core - this will happen in the next release). This entails:
  * `Measure` no longer contains sampling configurations but only specifies the `type` of data to collect (e.g., `dk.cachet.carp.memory`)
  * instead, sampling configuration is now done in the `SamplingConfiguration` and `SamplingScheme` classes (which can be part of a `StudyProtocol`).
  * default sampling configuration are now part of a `SamplingSchema` provided by the `SamplingPackage`. For example, periodic sampling in e.g. the `MemoryProbe` is configured using a `PeriodicSamplingConfiguration` in the `DeviceSamplingPackage`.
  * improved support for supporting 'connected devices' such as a wearable ECG monitor or an online weather service. This is configured using specialized `DeviceDescriptor` classes.
* Added support for storing data in a SQLite database using a `SQLiteDataEndPoint` data endpoint.
* Upgrade to Android `compileSdkVersion` 33. Make sure to update the `android/app/build.gradle` file and set the `compileSdkVersion` to 33.
* Upgraded to Dart 2.17 and Flutter 3.0
* Refactoring to comply to [official Dart recommended lint rules](https://pub.dev/packages/lints)
* Additional refactoring include:
  * `DeploymentDelayedTrigger` has been removed. Use `ElapsedTimeTrigger`.
  * `RecurrentScheduledTrigger` no longer supports the `remember` feature. Persistent sampling for app tasks is now supported by the persistent sampling configuration across app re-start as described above.
  * `AutomaticTask` is replaced by the `BackgroundTask` from carp_core.

## 0.33.0

* upgrade to `carp_core` v. 0.33.0
* support of new device model, incl. configuration of devices with device descriptors
* **BREAKING** - the `SmartphoneDeploymentController` no longer automatically deploys the study when calling `addStudy()`.
  * make sure to call the `tryDeployment()` method when you want the deployment to happen.
* the factory method for getting default sampling schemes (common, debug, etc.) are now instance members (rather than functions) on the singleton `SamplingPackageRegistry`.
* upgrade to `permission_handler: ^9.2.0`

## 0.32.3

* added `OneTimeTrigger` as a new trigger type.
* `timestamp` is now enforced (not null) on all `Datum` objects.

## 0.32.1

* notifications are no longer (re-)send when the app task queue is restored across app restart.

## 0.32.0

* upgrade to `permission_handler: ^8.3.0`
* **NOTE**
  * see the [permission_handler](https://pub.dev/packages/permission_handler) README on how to set up your app - for example:
  * on Android, in `build.graddle` set `compileSdkVersion 31`
  * on iOS, add permission to your `Info.plist` file and update the `Podfile`

## 0.31.4

* support for a `ConditionalPeriodicTrigger` which preiodically checks resume/pause conditions (originates from [#230](https://github.com/cph-cachet/carp.sensing-flutter/issues/230)).
* `PeriodicTrigger` now required a sampling `duration`.
* upgrade of `pubspec` libaries (`flutter_local_notifications`, `cron`, and `json`).
* re-generation of json serialization
* still cannot upgrade `permission_handler` since 8.2.0 gives a graddle compile error?????

## 0.31.1

* bug fix of [#221](https://github.com/cph-cachet/carp.sensing-flutter/issues/221).

## 0.31.0

* A CAMS-specific `StudyProtocol` named `SmartphoneStudyProtocol` has been reintroduced (c.f., v. 0.30.0). It turned out that there are several things which needs to be configured as part of a study protocol, which the generic `StudyProtocol` from carp_core doesn't support. The new `SmartphoneStudyProtocol` supports specifying:
  * The `StudyDescription` describing the study including the researcher responsible for the study.
  * The `DataEndPoint` specifying where and how to upload data.
* The `SmartphoneDeploymentService` is updated to handle the new `SmartphoneStudyProtocol`.
* `StudyDescription` now also supports specifying the URL of a study description and the privacy policy.

## 0.30.6

* separate method for asking permissions in `SmartphoneDeploymentController`
* bug fix of [#215](https://github.com/cph-cachet/carp.sensing-flutter/issues/215) - notifications can now be enabled/disabled in the `configure` method of the `SmartphoneDeploymentController`.

## 0.30.5

* all deployment information is now stored in a folder named `<local_application_path>/carp/deployments/<study_deployment_id>` where `local_application_path` is the folder where an application can place files that are private to the application.
  * On iOS, this is the `NSDocumentsDirectory` and this can be accessed like accessing files on iOS via the Finder.
  * On Android, Flutter files are stored in the `AppData` directory, which is located in the `data/data/<package_name>/app_flutter` folder. Files can be accessed via AndroidStudio.

## 0.30.4

* added support for the `DeploymentDelayedTrigger`
* `Settings` now have support for storing deployment information across app restart
* added local notifications to an `AppTask`

## 0.30.3+2

* small updates to `Settings`
* fixed a bug in path to json files in `FileDataManager`
* improvement to saving task list across app re-start
* `CAMSMasterDeviceDeployment` renamed to `SmartphoneDeployment` (to allign with the other naming using `Smartphone`)
* `StudyProtocolDescription` and `StudyProtocolReponsible` renamed to `StudyDescription` and `StudyReponsible`
* fix of bug in storing app tasks in `AppTaskController`
* updates to example apps

## 0.30.1

* `DebugLevel` is now an enum
* support for persistenly storing `AppTask`s on the `AppTaskController` queue across app re-start

## 0.30.0

* upgrade to null-safety, `carp_core` v. 0.30.0
* `CAMSStudyProtocol` is no longer used and is replaced by `StudyProtocol` in `carp_core`
* fix of bug in `RandomRecurrentTriggerExecutor` (Issue [#202](https://github.com/cph-cachet/carp.sensing-flutter/issues/202))

## 0.21.6

* bug fix of [#199](https://github.com/cph-cachet/carp.sensing-flutter/issues/199)

## 0.21.5

* rename of `ProtocolOwner` to `StudyProtocolReponsible` (in order not to confuse it with `ownerId` in `StudyProtocol`)

## 0.21.4

* small bug fixes
* upgrade to `carp_core 0.21.4`

## 0.21.3

* **NOTE** - `DataEndPoint` is no longer specified as part of a `StudyProtocol`.
  * Specifying where and how to store or upload data is really not part of specifying a study protocol, but rather a deployment issues. Therefore, the `DataEndPoint` is now part of a `MasterDeviceDeployment`.
  * The `SmartphoneDeploymentService` will use the `FileDataEndpoint` per default if not specified in the deployment. Hence, data is saved as files on the phone.
  * The `StudyDeploymentController.configure()` method now takes an optional `DataEndPoint` parameter to specify the data endpoint, if it should be different to what is specified in the deployment.
  * The `StudyDeploymentController.configure()` method also takes a `askForPermissions` parameter - if `false`, then CAMS will not ask for permissions, but hands this over to the app, which can show appropiate information to the user.
* settings are now a singleton accessed using `Settings()` (similar to other singletons in the framework)
* better support for handling json functions

## 0.21.2

* update to `carp_core` v. 0.21.2

## 0.21.1

* update to `carp_core` v. 0.21.0

## 0.21.0

* update to `carp_core` v. 0.21.0 client domain model
* support for using a `SmartPhoneClientManager` for executing multiple studies
* adjusted examples and example app to use the carp_core_client domain model

## 0.20.5

* Added a `RandomRecurrentTrigger` as a new trigger type (Issue [#170](https://github.com/cph-cachet/carp.sensing-flutter/issues/170))

## 0.20.4

* removed localization support again - this has to be handled on an application level, not as part of sensing.
* removed the `ConsentSection` also - again, this is separate to sensing.

## 0.20.3

* update to `carp_core` v. 0.20.3 (json serialization)

## 0.20.0

* **BREAKING**: Now using the [`carp_core`](https://pub.dev/packages/carp_core) domain models in order to align with the overall [domain-driven design of CARP](https://carp.cachet.dk/core/).
* This has an impact on the **naming** used in the API. The most important changes are:
  * `Study` is now called `StudyProtocol` and a CAMS-specific protocol called `CAMSStudyProtocol` is available
  * `PrincipalInvestigator` is now called `ProtocolOwner`
  * `Task` is now called `TaskDescriptor`
  * `Device` is now called `DeviceDescriptor`
  * `ManualTrigger` is now called `PassiveTrigger`
  * `ScheduledTrigger` is now called `DateTimeTrigger`
  * `Measure` is now called `CAMSMeasure` (but `Measure` is part of `carp_core`)
* A `StudyProtocol` now uses the concept of a [`TriggeredTask`](https://pub.dev/documentation/carp_core/latest/carp_core/TriggeredTask-class.html) which is slightly different to the previous `Study` model. See the [example](https://pub.dev/packages/carp_core/example).
* A `CAMSStudyProtocol` now supports localization. A `StudyProtocolDescription` and a list of `ConsentSection` can be added to a protocol for each locale (i.e., language code).
* Similarly, measures now also supports localization. For each `CAMSMeasure` there is the option to specify its `MeasureDescription` for each locale.  
* All json serialization of a protocol now use `camelCase` instead of `snake_case` to be consistent with `carp_core` in Kotlin.
  * Note, however, that `DataPoint` objects are still serialized as `snake_case` json.
* All the `events` streams are now called `data` and streams `DataPoint` data objects (instead of just the `Datum` data objects).
* The `DataPoint` comply to version 1.2 definition (Issue [#162](https://github.com/cph-cachet/carp.sensing-flutter/issues/162))

## 0.12.3

* extension of `Study` to include `purpose`, `title` and `PrincipalInvestigator`

* refactor: rename of `Device` to `DeviceInfo`

## 0.11.1

* feature: support for storing and retrieving study json protocols on the local file system.
* refactor: the `deploymentId` has been removed from `Study` since this is CARP specific info.

## 0.11.0

* refactor: improved (de)serialization in the `Serialization` class.
* refactor: named constructors in the `Study` and `Measure` classes.
* feature: support for handling local settings on the phone in the `Settings`.
* feature: added `description` property to `Measure`.
* feature: added support for an `AppTask` can expire, i.e. be removed from the queue.
* fix: issue [#139](https://github.com/cph-cachet/carp.sensing-flutter/issues/139)
* fix: issue [#140](https://github.com/cph-cachet/carp.sensing-flutter/issues/140)

## 0.10.1

* fix: issue [#123](https://github.com/cph-cachet/carp.sensing-flutter/issues/123)
* based on issue [#134](https://github.com/cph-cachet/carp.sensing-flutter/issues/134)
  the following measures has changed
  * `periodic_accelerometer` and `periodic_gyroscope` has been added
  * the "old" `accelerometer` and `gyroscope` measures are made to run continously
  * This implies that they need to be started and stopped using a `Trigger` instead.
  * This, however, open up for triggering the collection of accelerometer data as part of an `AppTask`. For example, sampling accelerometer data while a Parkinson's patient fill in a survey.

## 0.10.0

* **BREAKING**: a new `AppTask` model is implemented
  * see documentation on the CAMS [wiki](https://github.com/cph-cachet/carp.sensing-flutter/wiki/3.1-The-AppTask-Model).
  * see the [Pulmonary app](https://github.com/cph-cachet/pulmonary_monitor_app) for an example on how to use this new model.
* fix: issue [#98](https://github.com/cph-cachet/carp.sensing-flutter/issues/98)
* fix: issue [#114](https://github.com/cph-cachet/carp.sensing-flutter/issues/114)

* fix : issue [#112](https://github.com/cph-cachet/carp.sensing-flutter/issues/112)
  * this means that the `initialize()` method is no longer a `Future` (and hence cannot be awaited)

## 0.9.4+1

* fix: issue [#106](https://github.com/cph-cachet/carp.sensing-flutter/issues/106).
* fix: fix of race condition in `FileDataManager`

  * `ProbeRegistry`
  * `TransformerSchemaRegistry`
  * `DataManagerRegistry`
* fix: fixed issue [#100](https://github.com/cph-cachet/carp.sensing-flutter/issues/100)

* added the `MarkedMeasure` class for creating measures that collect all measures since last time data was collected.
Useful for collecting things like log entries and health data.
* added the `settings` global variable providing access to:
  * [`SharedPreferences`](https://pub.dev/documentation/shared_preferences/latest/shared_preferences/SharedPreferences-class.html)

* Added support for "manually" adding data points (`Datum`) and errors to the data stream (`events`). This is part of the `StudyExecutor` API.
* The `start()` method on all executors (probes, and study, trigger & task executors) has been removed.
Now an executor is 'started' by resuming it (calling `resume()`).
* Fixed a bug in `BufferingPeriodicStreamProbe`.
